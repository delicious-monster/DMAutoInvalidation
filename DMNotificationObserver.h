/* The action block is passed the notification, the owner as a parameter (to avoid retain cycles),
 * and the triggering observer (so it can easily invalidate it if it needs to). */

/* DMNotificationObserver is thread-safe. It's safe to create and call its method from any thread. Note that
 * if you create an observer on the main thread, and another object posts a notification on a background
 * thread, the action block will be run on the posting thread. (This is normal NSNotificationCenter behavior,
 * and we might want to define the environment better if lots of our clients end up doing a dispatch_async in
 * their action block.) */

/* The lifetime of a DMNotificationObserver is tied to its owner. Observers are automatically invalidated when
 * its owner is deallocated. Owners don't need to explicitly keep observers in strong storage (such as ivars);
 * instead, observers attach themselves to their owner with the associated objects API. */
